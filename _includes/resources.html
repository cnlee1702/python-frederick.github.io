      <h3>For data scientists</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re here to learn how to do data science
        in Python, then you’re in for a treat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python is a <strong>fantastic</strong> language
        for doing scientific analysis!
      </p>
      <p>
        Christine, our resident data scientist co-organizer,
        put together an excellent introduction
        into the tools to use
        to do data science in Python.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/python-frederick/talks/blob/master/2017-12-data-science/Data%20Science%20in%20Python.ipynb" target="_blank">presentation material on GitHub</a>.</p></li>

      <h3>For experienced devs</h3>
      <p>
        Maybe you’re a Java expert?
        Or perhaps you learned enough PHP
        to understand the basics of programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some great resources
        for people who already understand programming
        and want to learn a new language.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do code exercises and get mentoring
            from the team
            at <a href="https://exercism.io/" target="_blank">Exercism</a> (for free!).
